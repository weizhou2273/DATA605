##Problem 1

**Calculate as a minimum the below probabilities a through c. Assume the small letter "x" is estimated as the median of the X variable, and the small letter "y" is estimated as the 1st quartile of the Y variable. Interpret the meaning of all probabilities.**

Generate random variable X , Y 
```{r}
set.seed(12345)
N <- 10
n <- 10000
mu <- sigma <- (N + 1)/2
df <- data.frame(X = runif(n, min=1, max=N), 
                 Y = rnorm(n, mean=mu, sd=sigma))
summary(df$X)
summary(df$Y)
```

Probability:
```{r}
## Given that: 
x <- median(df$X)
y <- as.numeric(quantile(df$Y)["25%"])
x
y
```

1. $P(X>x|X>y)$ Interpretation:Probability that X is greater than its median given that X is greater than the first quartile of Y

$P(X>x|X>y) = \frac{P(X>x,X>y)}{P(X>y)}$

```{r}
P_Xx_and_Xy <- df %>%
  filter(X > x,
         X > y) %>%
  nrow() / n
P_Xy <- df %>%
  filter(X > y) %>%
  nrow() / n
ans_1a <- P_Xx_and_Xy / P_Xy
ans_1a
```


2. $P(X>x,Y>y)$ Interpretation: Probability that X is grater than its median and Y is greater than the first quartile of Y. 
```{r}
ans_1b <- df %>%
  filter(X > x,
         Y > y) %>%
  nrow() / n
ans_1b
```

3. $P(X<x|X>y)$ Interpretation: Probability that X is smaller than its median given that X is greate than the first quartile of Y. 

```{r}
P_Xsx_and_Xgy <- df %>%
  filter(X < x,
         X > y) %>%
  nrow() / n
P_Xgy <- df %>%
  filter(X > y) %>%
  nrow() / n
ans_1c <- P_Xsx_and_Xgy / P_Xgy
ans_1c
```


**Investigate whether P(X>x and Y>y)=P(X>x)P(Y>y) by building a table and evaluating the marginal and joint probabilities.**

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# Create Joint Probabilities
temp <- df %>%
  mutate(A = ifelse(X > x, " X > x", " X <= x"),
         B = ifelse(Y > y, " Y > y", " Y <= y")) %>%
  group_by(A, B) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(probability = count / n)
# Create Marginal Probabilities
temp <- temp %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(A) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(count),
            probability = sum(probability)) %>%
  mutate(B = "Total") %>%
  bind_rows(temp)
temp <- temp %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(B) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(count),
            probability = sum(probability)) %>%
  mutate(A = "Total") %>%
  bind_rows(temp)

# Create Table
temp %>%
  select(-count) %>%
  spread(A, probability) %>%
  rename(" " = B) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()
```
**Check to see if independence holds by using Fisher's Exact Test and the Chi Square Test. What is the difference between the two? Which is most appropriate?**

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, comment=NA}
count_data <- temp %>%
  filter(A != "Total",
         B != "Total") %>%
  select(-probability) %>%
  spread(A, count) %>%
  as.data.frame()
row.names(count_data) <- count_data$B
count_data <- count_data %>%
  select(-B) %>%
  as.matrix() 
fisher.test(count_data)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, comment=NA}
chisq.test(count_data)
```

*Fisher's Exact Test is for is used when sample size less than 5, while the Chi Square Test is used when the cell sizes are large. In this case, Chi Square would be appropriate.*

#Problem 2

**5 points. Descriptive and Inferential Statistics. Provide univariate descriptive statistics and appropriate plots for the training data set. Provide a scatterplot matrix for at least two of the independent variables and the dependent variable. Derive a correlation matrix for any THREE quantitative variables in the dataset. Test the hypotheses that the correlations between each pairwise set of variables is 0 and provide a 80% confidence interval. Discuss the meaning of your analysis. Would you be worried about familywise error? Why or why not?**

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning = FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(e1071)
library(pander)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(MASS)
library(rcompanion)
```

**Load Data**
```{r load-data}
# Load training data from GitHub
train <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weizhou2273/DATA605/master/hw/data/train.csv')
test <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weizhou2273/DATA605/master/hw/data/test.csv')

```

### Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
**Provide univariate descriptive statistics and appropriate plots for the training data set.**
```{r}
summary(train)
```
**Provide a scatterplot matrix for at least two of the independent variables and the dependent variable.**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
train %>%
  select(LotArea, GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, SalePrice) %>%
  pairs()
```

**Derive a correlation matrix for any three quantitative variables in the dataset.**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
correlation_matrix <- train %>%
  select(LotArea, GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr) %>%
  cor() %>%
  as.matrix()
correlation_matrix %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

**Test the hypothesis that the correlations between each pairwise set of variables is 0 and provide an 80% confidence interval.**

```{r, results="asis"}
zero_vars <- 0
test <- 0
variables <- train %>%
  select(-SalePrice) %>%
  names()
for(variable in variables){
  d <- train[,names(train) == variable]
  if(is.numeric(d)){
    test <- test + 1
    results <- cor.test(train$SalePrice, d, conf.level = 0.8)
    if(0 > results$conf.int[1] & results$conf.int[2] > 0){
      hypothesis_test_results <- "Yes"
      zero_vars <- zero_vars + 1
    } else {
      hypothesis_test_results <- "No"
    }
    print(paste(variable,': test result', hypothesis_test_results))
  }
}
```

**Discuss the meaning of your analysis. Would you be worried about familywise error? Why or why not?**

*There are `r zero_vars` variables that have no correlation with the sale price.*

*They are  Id, BsmtFinSF2, LowQualFinSF, BsmtHalfBath,MiscVal , YrSold*

*I would be worried be woried about family-wise error.*

*The family-wise error rate would be: ${FWER} = 1 - (1 - .2)^`r zero_vars` = 1 - `r .8 ^ zero_vars` = `r 1 - (.8^ zero_vars)`$.  This means there is a really high probability of committing a Type I error.*


### Linear Algebra and Correlation

**Invert your correlation matrix from above. (This is known as the precision matrix and contains variance inflation factors on the diagonal.)**

```{r}
precision_matrix <- inv(correlation_matrix)
precision_matrix %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

**Multiply the correlation matrix by the precision matrix, and then multiply the precision matrix by the correlation matrix.**

*This will generate the identity matrix.*

```{r}
correlation_matrix %*% precision_matrix %>%
  round() %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

*This will too.*

```{r}
precision_matrix %*% correlation_matrix %>%
  round() %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

**Conduct LU decomposition on the matrix.**

```{r}
lu_decomposition <- Matrix::expand(lu(correlation_matrix))
```

*The LU decomposition should yield the correlation matrix after multiplying the two components.  In other words this:*

```{r}
A <- lu_decomposition$L %*% lu_decomposition$U %>%
  as.matrix() 
colnames(A) <- colnames(correlation_matrix)
rownames(A) <- rownames(correlation_matrix)
A %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

*Should match this:*

```{r}
correlation_matrix %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

*Which it does.*

### Calculus-Based Probability & Statistics

**Many times, it makes sense to fit a closed form distribution to data. Select a variable in the Kaggle.com training dataset that is skewed to the right, shift it so that the minimum value is absolutely above zero if necessary. Then load the MASS package and run fitdistr to fit an exponential probability density function. (See https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/fitdistr.html). Find the optimal value of $\lambda$ for this distribution, and then take 1000 samples from this exponential distribution using this value (e.g., rexp(1000, $\lambda$)).**

*I will be using the Square Footage of the Unfinished Basement for this part of the exam.  I know it is right skewed because the mean (`r mean(train$BsmtUnfSF)`) is larger than the median (`r median(train$BsmtUnfSF)`) as shown in the figure below:*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(train, aes(BsmtUnfSF)) + geom_density() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(train$BsmtUnfSF), color = "red")+ 
  geom_vline(xintercept = median(train$BsmtUnfSF), color = "blue") +
  annotate("text", x = 700, y = 0.0005, label = "Mean", color="red") + 
  annotate("text", x = 300, y = 0.0005, label = "Median", color="blue")
```

*The minimum (`r min(train$BsmtUnfSF)`) is not smaller than zero so we don't need to shift the data.  Remember that the maximum value is `r max(train$BsmtUnfSF)`.  I have already loaded the MASS package.*

```{r}
lambda <- fitdistr(train$BsmtUnfSF, densfun = "exponential")$estimate
```

*The optimal value for $\lambda$ is `r lambda`.*

```{r}
samples <- rexp(1000, rate = lambda)
```

**Plot a histogram and compare it with a histogram of your original variable.**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
histogram_data <- data.frame(Value = samples, Data = c("Sample"))
histogram_data <- data.frame(Value = train$BsmtUnfSF, Data = c("Original")) %>%
  rbind(histogram_data) %>%
  mutate(Data = as.factor(Data))
ggplot(histogram_data, aes(Value, fill = Data)) + geom_histogram(bins = 50, alpha = 0.5)
```

*The original data is not quite exponential, but it's not a bad approximation.  The exponential distribution data has a longer tail than the basement square footage data.*

**Using the exponential pdf, find the 5th and 95th percentiles using the cumulative distribution function (CDF).**


*The PDF would be $f(x;\lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ where $x \geq 0$ and otherwise zero.*

*The CDF would be $F(x;\lambda) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}$.  lambda is `r lambda`. To find the 5th percentile we need to solve for x in:*

$$0.05 = 1 - e^{-`r lambda` x}$$

$$-0.95 = - e^{-`r lambda` x}$$

$$-ln(0.95) = `r lambda` x$$

$$x = \frac{-ln(0.95)}{`r lambda`} = `r -log(0.95)/lambda`$$
*For the 95th percentile we need to solve for x in:*

$$0.95 = 1 - e^{-`r lambda` x}$$

$$-0.05 = - e^{-`r lambda` x}$$

$$-ln(0.05) = `r lambda` x$$

$$x = \frac{-ln(0.05)}{`r lambda`} = `r -log(0.05)/lambda`$$

*So the 5th and 95th percentiles are approximately `r round(-log(0.95)/lambda,0)` and `r round(-log(0.05)/lambda,0)`, respectively.*

**Also generate a 95% confidence interval from the empirical data, assuming normality.**

```{r, comment=NA}
mu <- mean(train$BsmtUnfSF)
s <- sd(train$BsmtUnfSF)
n <- nrow(train)
error <- qnorm(0.975) * s / sqrt(n)
ci <- c(mu - error, mu + error)
names(ci) <- c("5%", "95%")
ci
```

*The 95% confidence interval (assuming normality) is `r round(ci[1])` to `r round(ci[2])`. Although what I think was meant was assume the data is normally distributed.  Calculate the 5th and 95th percentile.  That is found using $x = \mu + Z \sigma$.  The Z is -1.645 for the 5th percentile, and 1.645 for the 95th.  So the percentiles would be `r round(mu + (-1.645 * s), 0)` and `r round(mu + (1.645 * s), 0)`.*

**Finally, provide the empirical 5th percentile and 95th percentile of the data. Discuss.**

```{r, comment=NA}
quantile(train$BsmtUnfSF, c(0.05, 0.95))
```

*The actual 5th percentile is `r quantile(train$BsmtUnfSF, c(0.05))` and the 95th is `r quantile(train$BsmtUnfSF, c(0.95))`.  So the findings are summarized in the following table:*

| Method | 5% | 95% |
| ------ |:--:|:---:|
| Exponential CDF | `r round(-log(0.95)/lambda,0)` | `r round(-log(0.05)/lambda,0)` |
| Normal 95% CI | `r round(ci[1])`      | `r round(ci[2])` |
| Normal Percentiles | `r round(mu + (-1.645 * s), 0)`  | `r round(mu + (1.645 * s), 0)` | 
| Emperical Percentiles | `r round(quantile(train$BsmtUnfSF, c(0.05)),0)`       | `r round(quantile(train$BsmtUnfSF, c(0.95)),0)` |

*If we model the data as exponentially distributed the 5th percentile is `r round(-log(0.95)/lambda,0)`.  If we model it as normally distributed the 5th is at `r round(mu + (-1.645 * s), 0)` which in the context of square footage does not make any sense. The actual 5th percentile is `r round(quantile(train$BsmtUnfSF, c(0.05)),0)`. The difference is explained to the assumed shape/distibution of the underlying data.*

*Looking at the 95th percentile we have `r round(-log(0.5)/lambda,0)` if the data are exponentially distributed, `r round(mu + (1.645 * s), 0)` if it is normally distributed and `r round(quantile(train$BsmtUnfSF, c(0.95)),0)` in reality.  Again the difference is due to the assumed shape.*

*I have left out the 95% CI from the discussion because the confidence interval is a way of estimating the mean of the population.  We would know if we took 100 estimates that the actual mean falls within the confidence intervals 95% of the time.  Within this context it is meaningless.*


### Modeling

**Build some type of multiple regression model and submit your model to the competition board. Provide your complete model summary and results with analysis. Report your Kaggle.com user name and score.**

*Since there are so many variables I will be using a random forest to detect which variables are the most important and will be using them to build the model.  First I will drop out the variables that are missing a lot of data or otherwise meaningless.*
```{r}
fill_holes <- function(df){
  df %>%
    mutate(BedroomAbvGr = replace_na(BedroomAbvGr, 0),
           BsmtFullBath = replace_na(BsmtFullBath, 0),
           BsmtHalfBath = replace_na(BsmtHalfBath, 0),
           BsmtUnfSF = replace_na(BsmtUnfSF, 0),
          EnclosedPorch = replace_na(EnclosedPorch, 0),
          Fireplaces = replace_na(Fireplaces, 0),
          GarageArea = replace_na(GarageArea, 0),
          GarageCars = replace_na(GarageCars, 0),
          HalfBath = replace_na(HalfBath, 0),
          KitchenAbvGr = replace_na(KitchenAbvGr, 0),
          LotFrontage = replace_na(LotFrontage, 0),
          OpenPorchSF = replace_na(OpenPorchSF, 0),
          PoolArea = replace_na(PoolArea, 0),
          ScreenPorch = replace_na(ScreenPorch, 0),
          TotRmsAbvGrd = replace_na(TotRmsAbvGrd, 0),
          WoodDeckSF = replace_na(WoodDeckSF, 0)) 
}
train = fill_holes(train)
test <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weizhou2273/DATA605/master/hw/data/test.csv')
test  = fill_holes(test)
```


```{r}
model <- lm(SalePrice ~ OverallQual + YearBuilt + YearRemodAdd + TotalBsmtSF + X1stFlrSF + GrLivArea + FullBath + TotRmsAbvGrd + GarageCars + GarageArea, data = train)

summary(model)
```
```{r}
mySalePrice <- predict(model,test)

##create dataframe
prediction <- data.frame( Id = test[,"Id"],  SalePrice = mySalePrice)
prediction[prediction<0] <- 0
prediction <- replace(prediction,is.na(prediction),0)
  
head(prediction)
```

```{r}
#write.csv(prediction, file="prediction.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

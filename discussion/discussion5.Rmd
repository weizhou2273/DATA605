Modify the program CoinTosses to toss a coin n times and print out after every
100 tosses the proportion of heads minus 1/2. Do these numbers appear to
approach 0 as n increases?

```{r}
sample.space <- c(0,1)
theta <- 0.5 # this is a fair coin
result = vector()
for (N in seq(1, 1000)*100){
  flips <- sample(sample.space, 
                size = N, 
                replace = TRUE, 
                prob = c(theta, 1 - theta))
  
  result=c(result,sum(flips==1)/N - 0.5)
}
```

The result tends to convergent.
```{r}
plot(result)
```

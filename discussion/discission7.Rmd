#### The Poisson distribution with parameter lambda = .3 has been assigned for the outcome of an experiment. Let X be the outcome function. Find P(X =0), P(X = 1), and P(X > 1)
P(X=0)
```{r}
library('stats')
lambda = 0.3
p0 = dpois(0,lambda)
p0
```

P(X=1)
```{r}
p1 = dpois(1,lambda)
p1
```

P(X>1) = 1-P(X<=1) = 1-P(X=0) - P(X=1)
```{r}
P = 1-p0-p1
P
```
